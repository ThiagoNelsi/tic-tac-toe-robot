# Tic-tac-toe Robot!
### Can you beat a robot in the tic-tac-toe game? 

I'm learning rust, so I decided to create a robot that plays tic tac toe game!

The robot is based on the montecarlo algorithm and let's you to select the level of difficulty of the game,
in other words: "how much the robot will think before make his decision".

## Try it

The project uses Cargo, so you can simply run it by opening the terminal on the project folder and typing `cargo run`.

> Just be sure to have Rust and Cargo installed on your computer.
